This is Camilla's personal for testing out new tech

You can reach the deployed version at http://cmd.fyi.

## Development

1. Use the correct Node version specified in `.nvmrc` by running (needs `nvm` to be installed)

```sh
$ nvm use
```

2. Install the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Run the Remix development server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Your file changes are watched, and assets are rebuilt upon change.

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
